# SMPL

A braindead simple programming language entirely for learning how language design works. **To be clear** you should not use this language for anything but learnign as it will almost certainly be bad as a real language

## Build

Build requires `cmake` and a `c++ compiler (clang, g++, etc.)`

Simply run:
```bash
make
```
from the root directory of the project.
